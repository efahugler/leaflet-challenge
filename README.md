Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

## Before You Begin


 1. Create a new repository for this project called leaflet-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

 2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

 3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Leaflet challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: Leaflet-Step-1 and Leaflet-Step-2.

 4. This homeworks utilizes both html and Javascript so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.

 5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Your Task

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.

  1. Get your data set

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.
